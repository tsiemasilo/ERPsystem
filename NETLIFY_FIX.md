# Netlify API Fix - Action Required

## Issue
The main React app is loading correctly, but API endpoints are returning 404 errors.

## Root Cause
The serverless functions aren't being recognized by Netlify.

## Immediate Fix

### 1. Test the New Functions
After deploying these changes, test these endpoints:

- **Test function**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/test`
- **KPIs function**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/kpis`

### 2. Check Environment Variables
Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in Netlify:
- Site Settings → Environment Variables
- Add `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon database connection string

### 3. Alternative API Endpoints
If the redirects aren't working, try direct function calls:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/kpis`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/test`

## Files Added

✅ **netlify/functions/test.js** - Simple diagnostic function  
✅ **netlify/functions/kpis.js** - Direct KPIs endpoint  
✅ **netlify/functions/api-simple.js** - Simplified API handler  

## Expected Results

1. **Test endpoint** should return:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Netlify function is working!",
     "timestamp": "2025-01-11T...",
     "environment": {
       "DATABASE_URL": "Set"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **KPIs endpoint** should return:
   ```json
   {
     "totalOrders": 55,
     "totalRevenue": "51098.65",
     "totalProducts": 35,
     "totalCustomers": 20
   }
   ```

## Next Steps After Deploy

1. **Test Functions**: Visit the test endpoint first
2. **Check Logs**: Netlify Functions → View logs for errors
3. **Verify Environment**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is set
4. **Update Frontend**: If needed, update API calls to use direct function URLs

## If Functions Work

Update your frontend API calls to use direct function URLs:
- Change `/api/dashboard/kpis` to `/.netlify/functions/kpis`
- Or fix the redirects in `netlify.toml`

## Files Ready for GitHub Push

All the diagnostic and fix files are ready to push to GitHub and redeploy on Netlify.
